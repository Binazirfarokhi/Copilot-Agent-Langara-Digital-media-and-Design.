# Registration Copilot for Microsoft 365

## 🎯 Problem

Students often ask the same questions about registration:
- “How do I register for the next term?”
- “Where can I see important deadlines?”
- “Who do I contact if I have a problem with registration?”

Information is spread across multiple pages and documents, and support staff spend time answering the same questions repeatedly.

   Example: “How can I register for the Winter 2026 term?”

2. **Copilot interprets the intent**
   - Detects category: *"registration process"*, *"deadlines"*, *"who to contact"*, etc.

3. **Copilot retrieves grounded information**
   - Uses connected knowledge sources (SharePoint pages, official PDFs, FAQ documents).
